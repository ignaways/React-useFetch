# React-useFetch
This is a tutorial on building a custom useFetch hook in React js / React native for fetching data from the API âœ¨

## Introduction
use useFetch to build our own custom hook to extract component logic for fetching data into a reusable component function. We'll create the useFetch hook to fetch data from different API endpoints without unnecessary code repetition.

## Usage
- cd **`app`**
- run **`npm install`**
- run in new terminal **`json-server --watch db.json`**
- run in new terminal **`npm run start`**
